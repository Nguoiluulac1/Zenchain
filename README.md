# Zenchain
Introduce Zenchain, its key features (cross-chain, DeFi, NFT, EVM/Wasm compatibility, Cosmos SDK).
# Zenchain Protocol

**Zenchain Protocol** is an innovative **Layer 1 blockchain** designed to revolutionize **cross-chain interoperability**, with a specific focus on seamless communication between **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum**. Built using the robust **Cosmos SDK** and powered by the efficient **Tendermint Core** consensus engine, Zenchain boasts full compatibility with both **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** and **WebAssembly (Wasm)**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Enabling smooth asset and data transfers between disparate blockchain networks, especially BTC and ETH, through our advanced **Cross-Chain Interoperability Module (CCIM)**.
* **Web3 & Smart Contract Compatibility:** Supports both **EVM** for Solidity-based smart contracts and **Wasm** for high-performance decentralized applications, opening doors for a wide range of developers.
* **High Throughput & Scalability:** Leverages Tendermint Core for fast transaction finality and harnesses **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)** for horizontal scalability, ensuring the network can handle significant loads.
* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) & NFTs:** Designed with native support for core DeFi applications and Non-Fungible Tokens, fostering a vibrant ecosystem.
* **Hybrid Consensus Mechanism:** Utilizing the **RAGE** and **GUARDIAN** consensus models for enhanced security and efficiency.
